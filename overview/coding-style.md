# Coding Style



1. Use 4 spaces indentation.
2. You must put each statement on a separate line. Newline is the statement separator.
3. Naming: `SomeDataType`, `someFunction`, `some_data_binding`, `some_module_alias`.
4. If a function returns a type \(generic types\) it should be named like a type.
5. If a binding is a reference to a function, it should be named like that function.
6. You can use `0x` prefix for hexadecimal numbers and `0b` for binary.
7. You can use `_` as digit separator in number literals.
