# Map



1. HashMap is a hash table of key values.
2. You can use `[KeyType:ValueType]` to define a map type. 
3. When reading from a map, you will get runtime error if value does not exist in the map.
4. An empty map can be denoted using `[:]` notation.
5. Core defines built-in functions for maps for common operations: `slice, map, reduce, filter, anyMatch, allMatch, ...`

**Examples**

```perl
pop = ["A":1, "B":2, "C":3]
data = pop["A"]
```
